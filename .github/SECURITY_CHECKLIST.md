## üöÄ Recommended Actions Before Going Public

### Immediate (Do Before First Public Commit)

1. **Review all files** for accidentally committed secrets:
   ```bash
   # Search for common secret patterns
   git grep -i "password\|secret\|api[_-]key\|token" -- ':!SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md' ':!SECURITY.md'
   ```

2. **Check email addresses**:
   ```bash
   git grep -E "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"
   ```

3. **Verify .gitignore**:
   ```bash
   cat .gitignore
   ```

### Short-term (Within First Week)

1. **Revoke exposed credentials**:
   - ‚úÖ MailerSend API key has been removed (recommend revoking if it was ever committed)
   - Generate new credentials for any service that was exposed

2. **Set up GitHub Security Features**:
   - Enable Dependabot alerts
   - Enable secret scanning
   - Configure branch protection rules

3. **Add LICENSE file** (if not already present)

### Long-term (Ongoing)

1. **Regular security audits**:
   - Review dependencies quarterly
   - Update Spring Boot and dependencies regularly
   - Monitor GitHub security advisories

2. **Community engagement**:
   - Respond to security reports promptly
   - Maintain SECURITY.md with current contact info
   - Document security releases in CHANGELOG

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Safe "Secrets" (Development Only)

These are safe to keep as they're clearly documented as examples:

- Example email addresses in documentation (`example.com` domain)
- Test database credentials (empty or `sa` for H2)

## üîí Post-Publication Security

After making the repository public:

1. **Monitor for leaked secrets**:
   - Set up GitHub secret scanning
   - Use git-secrets or similar tools locally

2. **Respond to security reports**:
   - Check email regularly for security reports
   - Respond within 48 hours
   - Follow responsible disclosure guidelines

3. **Keep dependencies updated**:
   - Run `./gradlew dependencyUpdates` monthly
   - Apply security patches promptly
